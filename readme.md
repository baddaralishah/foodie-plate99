# Plate99
 
 Web based food and recipes sharing application based on Laravel framework! Official Website running v1.2 [Plate99 Website](http://plate99.com). Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. I believe development has enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. I have developed this application using two mixup front-end templates which are [![lightbootstrap-dashboard] (https://github.com/creativetimofficial/light-bootstrap-dashboard) and [![Box Portfolio] (http://ahmedessa.net/box.html).
